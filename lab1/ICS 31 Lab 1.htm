</font></p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>We encourage you to talk with each other and help each other understand how to do the assignments. There are some limits, though; in particular, remember that knowing how to do it (when the quizzes and exams come, for example) is much more important than just putting down the answer. If you haven't already, read the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</a>. You may also wish to read some general advice about <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/college.html">how to approach college work</a>; not all of the practices that served you well in secondary school will work well here.
</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Read Chapter 1 of the Perkovic textbook; it provides some background, including some issues we talked about in class on Thursday.</p>
<p>These "preparation" sections of each assignment will include the reading in the textbook and some exercises for you to try out as you read. People learn best when they apply what they read as they go, so it's best to read the book with a computer at hand so you can type things in and try them out. There's always a big gap between thinking you understand something you read and actually being able to apply it. We expect these exercises to go quickly, but if you find yourself spending more than a couple of minutes on an exercise without making any progress, you should ask about it (on Piazza, probably) rather than continuing to spin your <a title="Click to Continue &gt; by I Want This" id="_GPLITA_1" style="text-decoration:underline" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/hw/lab1.html#" in_rurl="http://i.trkjmp.com/click?v=VVM6MjY2MjY6MTE1MDp3aGVlbHM6YTEzZTQ2ZjBhOWI3NjZhMzRlZTlhNWYwMTQ3ZDhmMmU6ei0xMjA5LTM4OTQxOnd3dy5pY3MudWNpLmVkdToxNjk2NDpjY2MyZmZiNDhmODQ1NmEzZmM3NzI5NzZjMjAxMTc2Yg">wheels</a> unproductively. Note that this also means you should get started early, so that you'll have the time to get any questions answered.</p>
<p>[Reading note: In Chapter 1 on page 3, the author characterizes different career paths in computing. But he mis-characterizes work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) when he says, "Artistic computer professionals design the interfaces that clients use to interact with an application." Designing interfaces is not primarily an artistic activity and many people who work in HCI have no particular artistic interest or ability. Instead, HCI designers are experimenters, observing how actual users perform when using a design and refining the design based on what they observe. UCI is a world leader in HCI research; ICS offers half a dozen undergrad courses in various aspects of HCI.]</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Read sections 2.1â2.4 of the Perkovic text. You don't have to do all of this by Monday, but we'll be talking about material in sections 2.1 and 2.2 on Tuesday and sections 2.3 and 2.4 on Thursday.</p>
<p>As you're reading, you will run into "Practice Problem" sections. Do at least two of the parts in each of these sections. It's important that you apply what you're reading; it's impossible to learn this material without actually working through it. If you have more time, or if you have trouble with these, you should do more of them. Especially early in the course, it may seem tedious and slow because you're just learning your way. But the effort here will pay off in a greater facility later (or, to put it negatively, failing to do this now will result in disappointing performance later).</p>
<p>We don't require you to turn in your answers to the practice problems; the solutions are at the end of the chapter. But don't just read the problem, turn to the solution, and say, "Yeah, that looks right." Write down your answer first; force yourself to work it through. That's how you learn.</p>
<p>[Reading note: At the beginning of section 2.3, the the list of pet names is homogeneousâall the items are of the same type, strings. Next, the author shows you a heterogenous listâone with items of various types. In our class, we will use lists only for homogeneous data (so, for example, we can apply the same operation to every item on a list); for heterogeneous collections of data, we will use namedtuples (as discussed in class).]</p>
<p><strong>(5) </strong>Read through the Lab Work part of this assignment before you come to lab on Monday, just to get an idea of what you'll be doing with your partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><strong>Lab Work</strong></font> (Do this part with your partner in lab)</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Choose a partner for this assignment and make sure the TA knows who your partner is. Remember that you'll choose a different partner for each lab assignment, so you'll work with this partner only this week. Make sure you know your partner's name (first and last) and contact information (Email or cellphone or whatever) in case one of you can't make it to lab. 
</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> In the Python Shell in IDLE, type any expression, like <code>17 * 5</code>, and hit Return. The shell evaluates it and displays its value. Now type <code>print(17 * 5)</code> and evaluate it. You get the same value. (The book will get to Python's print statement a little later, but we're going to find it useful now.) </p>
<p>But try it with a string expression: Evaluate <code>'ics31'[2]</code>, then evaluate <code>print('ics31'[2])</code>. You get the same value, but without the quotation marks. When we're working on small pieces of our code directly in the Python interpreter (the Python Shell window), it doesn't matter much to us whether we see the quotes or not. But in a real program, we don't usually want quotes around our strings. We don't know quite enough yet to write complete programs, but as you work on the exercises in this assignment, you may want to type them into a Python file to edit and save them. If you type Python code into a Python file and run it (from the Run menu), you need to print expressions to see their values. </p>
<p>In IDLE, create a new file and save it as <code>lab1.py</code>. When you have your personal ICS lab account, save the file on your personal H: drive (or on a removable thumb drive). If you save it on the common C: drive, someone else might pick it up later (by mistake, we hope, but it would still lead to a lot of awkward questions about academic honesty). Keeping personal information secure is a real-world skill; people who work with health and other personal information can get in huge trouble if they leave it open to unauthorized access.
</p><p>On the first line of the file type a pound sign followed by the names and IDs of both partners and some other identifying information, like this: 
</p><pre> #  Paula Programmer 11223344 and Andrew Anteater 44332211.  ICS 31 Lab sec 7.  Lab asst 1.
</pre>
<p>Now put in a couple of print statements that print some expressions, and run the code in the file. Once you have this working, continue with the rest of this assignment. Paste your answers  into your  <code>lab1.py</code> file, which you will submit via Checkmate. (It's a good idea if each partner keeps a copy of the lab work at the end of each session, just in case someone can't make it to the next lab.)</p>
<p><strong>(c)</strong> At the end of Chapter 2, do these exercises: Exercise 2.12: choose one part from (a) to (e); Exercise
  2.13: chose one from (a) to (c) plus one from (d) to (f); Exercise
  
  2.14: choose two of the letters listed; Exercise
  
2.15: choose three from (a) to (g).</p>
<p>Then do exercises 2.16,
  2.17,
  2.18,
  2.21, and
  2.22.</p>
<p><strong>(d)</strong> Given this code (which you may copy and paste into your file to work with):</p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
Book = namedtuple('Book', 'title author year price')

<p>Write expressions using the variables <code>favorite</code>, <code>another</code>, and <code>still_another</code> that evaluate to each of the following:</p>
<p><strong>(d.1)</strong> the title of the book in the variable  <code>still_another</code> .</p>
<p><strong>(d.2)</strong> the price of the book <em>Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</em></p>
<p><strong>(d.3)</strong> the average price of all three books</p>
<p><strong>(</strong><strong>d.4)</strong> True or false, based on whether the publication year of the book in the variable <code>favorite</code> is before 1900.</p>
<p>Next, write two assignment statements:</p>
<p><strong>(d.5) </strong>Change the price of the book <em>Return of Sherlock Holmes</em> to $26.00</p>
<p><strong>(d.6) </strong>Change the price of the book <em>Return of Sherlock Holmes</em> by increasing it 20%</p>
<p><strong>(e)</strong> Define a namedtuple called <code>Animal</code> for animals in a zoo, with fields for the animal's name, its species, its age, its weight, and its favorite food.
  
</p><p>Then define variables to hold (i) an elephant called Jumbo that's 50 years old, weighs 1000 kg, and eats peanuts, and (ii) a platypus named Perry that's 7 years old, weighs 1.7 kg, and eats shrimp.
</p><p>Finally, write a boolean expression whose value is true if the weight of the animal represented by the first variable is less than the weight of the animal represented by the second variable.
</p><p>You might be asking yourself why it's useful to write an expression like that when we know from looking at the data that Jumbo weighs more than Perry. The answer is that variables can vary; that is, we might have a program where different animals, or different weights for the same animals, get stored in the variables you defined. Because the expression you wrote uses whatever value the variable currently has, we can re-use that same expression for whatever animals we want, so long as we store those animals' information in the variables you defined and used in your expression. It's good to write versatile code like this.
</p><p><strong>(f)</strong> Add this statement to your book code:  
</p><p><code>booklist = [favorite, another, still_another]</code>
</p><p><strong>(f.1) </strong>Write a boolean expression whose value is true if the first book on the list [remember what the index number of the first book is] is cheaper than the second book on the list (and false otherwise)
</p><p><strong>(f.2) </strong>Write another boolean expression whose value is true if the first book on the list is more recently published than the last book on the list. Don't write this using <code>booklist[2]</code> for the last book; instead, use an expression whose value would be the last book on the list, no matter how long the list is.
</p><p><strong>(g)</strong><strong></strong> Remember that each partner must complete a partner evaluation form and submit it individually. Do this by connecting to eee.uci.edu and choosing the Survey tool for your lab section of ICS 31. Make sure you know your partner's name, first and last, so you can evaluate the right person. Please complete your evaluation by the end of the day on Friday, or Saturday morning at the latest. It only takes a couple of minutes and not doing it hurts your participation score.
  
</p><p><strong>What to turn in:</strong> Submit via Checkmate your  <code>lab1.py</code> file containing your solutions to parts (c) through (f). It would be an excellent idea to go back and re-read those parts carefully now, to make sure you've completed all the steps specified. Also remember that each student must complete a partner evaluation form by logging in to eee.uci.edu and selecting the Survey tool; these evaluations contribute to your class participation score. Get in the habit of doing this every week on Friday after you've submitted your assignment; the survey closes on Saturday.
